A -q option to make it less verbose would probably be nice. Until we
have a dedicated 'update' command we'll need to run the setup every
time one of the commands has been changed on master.

# TODO: 
#   [ ] Write all the functions
#   [ ] Move various stuff into constants to clean code (maybe)
#   [ ] Rearrange the functions so they appear in a useful manner in the source

import sys
import os, os.path
import subprocess
import argparse

import rsupdate # This is here because i intended to pull the installation functions from a separate update script eventually, so you dont have to run a full setup just to update your project. this is here as a reminder of that.

# List of all functions called by the 3 main functions and a bit about their innards
# [x] get_rsp_src_dir(cl_source=""): returns directory with project source, trying the clarg first. possibly just wrapper for get_dir()
# [x] get_install_dir(cl_dest=""): same as get_rsp_src_dir(), but for an empty folder to install into
# [ ] get_default_pref(cl_default=""): possibly just a wrapper for some choice function. or replaced with a call to said choice function
# [ ] is_global_install(cl_glob=""): see get_default_pref()
# [ ] build_sys(build_dir, command): calls command ([dev]build|clean|config) for each file in the build directory
# [ ] add_rc_block(name, rc_data, clash="break"): takes name of block, data, and collision response. break: throw an error, new: overwrite old with new on an item-by-item basis, old: ditto but reversed, clobber: overwrite whole block. also generates rc file if it doesnt exist yet
# [ ] set_default_root(root): sets the default root as defined in the rc file
# [ ] get_rsp_dir(cl_dir=""): same as get_rsp_src_dir() but for an install, not source. Maybe have rc file have a list of all installs, and check against that?
# [ ] get_persist_pref(cl_persist=""): see get_default_pref()
# [ ] for_each_file_do(root, command, fail, subs=True): do command for each file under root, recursively if subs. fail is the behaviour for a failed command(non-zero exit). break immediately? catalog all fails and return the list after? something else i havent thought of yet? maybe shouldnt be a function
# [x] get_dest_dir(cl_dest=""): identical to get_install_dir. probably a different prompt message
# [ ] refactor_prog(root): some sort of function to go through root and correct any issues caused by moving an installation. maybe should take old root too?
# [ ] read_rc_block(name): get the name data block in the rc file
# [ ] remove_rc_block(name): delete the name data block in the rc file
# [ ] update_rc_block(name, data): probably the same as add_rc_block with clash="new"
### [ ] Note: the 4 *_rc_block functions might be imported from some other rc management script
### [ ] Note: possible the way add_rc_block() generates new rc files is with a sub call to gen_rc().
### [x] Note: many of these functions suggest the existance of a get_dir() function that asks the same question over and over until a directory with given contents exists. args would probably be `msg, dir_contents, strict_contents`. msg being the thing to print, dir_contents a list of what needs to be found, and strict_contents a bool indicating if other things can also exist.
